When invoking the `ccipSend` [function](/ccip/api-reference/i-router-client#ccipsend), it is possible to encounter various errors. These might be thrown either by the CCIP router or by one of the downstream contracts called by the CCIP router. Below is a compiled list of potential errors you might encounter. Referencing this list will enable you to capture and handle these exceptions gracefully.
